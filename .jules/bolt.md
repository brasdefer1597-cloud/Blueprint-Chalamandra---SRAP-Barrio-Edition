## 2024-05-22 - [Event Handling Redundancy]
**Learning:** The codebase heavily utilizes inline `onclick` handlers (e.g., `onclick="renderLevel(0)"`) alongside programmatically added event listeners for accessibility (e.g., `keydown` to trigger `click()`). This dual approach creates a split in event logic.
**Action:** When optimizing or refactoring, prioritize unifying event handling (e.g., using delegation for both clicks and keyboard events) to reduce code duplication and potential sync issues, while respecting the existing inline handler pattern for now.
