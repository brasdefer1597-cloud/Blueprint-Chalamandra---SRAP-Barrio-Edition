## 2024-05-22 - [Event Handling Redundancy]

**Learning:** The codebase heavily utilizes inline `onclick` handlers (e.g., `onclick="renderLevel(0)"`) alongside programmatically added event listeners for accessibility (e.g., `keydown` to trigger `click()`). This dual approach creates a split in event logic.
**Action:** When optimizing or refactoring, prioritize unifying event handling (e.g., using delegation for both clicks and keyboard events) to reduce code duplication and potential sync issues, while respecting the existing inline handler pattern for now.

## 2024-05-22 - [DOM Manipulation Efficiency]

**Learning:** Frequent UI updates using `innerHTML` on static containers (like `#chaos-metric-display`) force unnecessary re-parsing and layout thrashing.
**Action:** For high-frequency updates, use static HTML structures with specific ID targets (e.g., `<span id="metric-val">`) and update `textContent` and `className` directly. This preserves the DOM tree and improves rendering performance.

## 2026-02-25 - [Targeted DOM Updates]
**Learning:** Rendering logic that loops over all sections to hide them (O(N)) is unnecessary if `gameState` tracks the current visible section, allowing for O(1) transition by hiding only the previous and showing the new.
**Action:** Replace `querySelectorAll` loops in state transitions with direct ID lookups using `gameState.previous` or similar tracking.
