## 2024-05-22 - [Event Handling Redundancy]

**Learning:** The codebase heavily utilizes inline `onclick` handlers (e.g., `onclick="renderLevel(0)"`) alongside programmatically added event listeners for accessibility (e.g., `keydown` to trigger `click()`). This dual approach creates a split in event logic.
**Action:** When optimizing or refactoring, prioritize unifying event handling (e.g., using delegation for both clicks and keyboard events) to reduce code duplication and potential sync issues, while respecting the existing inline handler pattern for now.

## 2024-05-22 - [DOM Manipulation Efficiency]

**Learning:** Frequent UI updates using `innerHTML` on static containers (like `#chaos-metric-display`) force unnecessary re-parsing and layout thrashing.
**Action:** For high-frequency updates, use static HTML structures with specific ID targets (e.g., `<span id="metric-val">`) and update `textContent` and `className` directly. This preserves the DOM tree and improves rendering performance.

## 2024-05-23 - [Redundant DOM Loops]

**Learning:** `updateUI` was iterating over all interactive elements (steps, hats) on every interaction to update their visual state, leading to O(N) operations.
**Action:** Split visual updates: update specific elements in their event handlers (O(1)) and use `updateUI` only for global metrics. Use `syncAllVisuals` only on initialization.
